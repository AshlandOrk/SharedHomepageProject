        <p>
          Maitake mushrooms, whether cultivated or grown in the wild, are
          intensely flavored with a texture that even mushroom haters could get
          past. Maitake mushrooms do not have that squeaky texture, but rather a
          delicate and feathery texture. Most chefs would describe the Maitake
          mushroom as almost having leaves or feathers and all you really do is
          pull each little piece apart and sauté them, so no slicing is needed.
          Maitake mushrooms grow to be quite large, so in some instances you can
          slice off a chunk and cook it like a steak, either grilling or
          sautéing the slice whole. Maitake mushrooms are very versatile and can
          be sauteed on their own or added to dishes like pasta, risotto or
          eggs.

          <h3>Lowers Blood Sugar</h3>
          <p>
            Research studies have shown that Maitake mushrooms may work to
            decrease insulin resistance thereby increasing insulin sensitivity.

          <h3>Fights Cancer</h3>
          <p>
            The beta glucans in Maitake mushrooms help to activate and produce
            white blood cells called macrophages. Macrophages work in the body
            to ingest and destroy tumor cells. This can help to make
            chemotherapy more effective. Maitake mushrooms are also shown to
            lessen the side effects of anti-cancer drugs by decreasing nausea,
            vomiting, and hair loss.

          <h3>Boosts Immune System</h3>
          <p>
            Maitake mushrooms contain a polysaccharide fiber called beta glucan.
            The beta glucans in Maitake mushrooms works to activate and increase
            production of certain immune system cells. These cells can help the
            immune system to more quickly and efficiently fight against illness.

          <h3>Heart Health & Weight Loss</h3>
          <p>
            Eating Maitake mushrooms can help to decrease blood pressure levels,
            lower total cholesterol levels, and help maintain weight which can
            all help to promote heart health. The mushrooms are found to be low
            in calories and high in fiber which can increase satiety and
            feelings of fullness.

          The facilities of Shogun Maitake in London, Ontario were carefully
          designed to ensure that the mushrooms were grown in a safe and
          controlled environment. The result, is a Maitake mushroom which is
          free of pesticides and chemicals, and will exceed expectations in
          terms of taste, texture and freshness. Shogun Maitake uses
          state-of-the-art technology in order to replicate the natural growing
          conditions for Maitake mushrooms (mountains of northeastern Japan).
          This technology allows for the careful control and manipulation of
          humidity/temperature (and other factors) conditions to which factors)
          conditions to which the mushrooms are subjected. Shogun Maitake uses a
          proprietary growing process which was pioneered by our founder and
          CEO, Yoshinobu Odaira. This process was developed many years ago when
          others said that the artificial cultivation of Maitake mushrooms was
          impossible. Working day and night over the course of many months, Mr.
          Odaira was successfully able to develop a protocol which would allow
          for the mass production of Maitake mushrooms by replicating the
          changes seasons inside a factory setting.
